            Our menu section is a gastronomic journey in itself. Each dish is
            showcased with high-definition images, detailed descriptions, and
            perhaps a short story behind its creation. Categories are neatly
            organized – appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks. A
            user-friendly filter system allows visitors to sort by dietary
            preferences, ingredients, or meal types.
